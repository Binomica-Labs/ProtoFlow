Title: TSS Chemically Competent E. coli cell prep
Description: How to make competent cells for heat shock transformation via TSS buffer.
1. Streak a sample of E. coli cells onto LB-Agar and incubate overnight at 37C.
2. The following day, select one colony with a sterile pipette tip or toothpick and place it in 20mL of liquid LB Broth in a 125mL erlenmeyer flask. shake the flask overnight at 37C, 250rpm.
3. The following day, dispense 1mL of the overnight culture into a sterile 250mL flask containing 100mL of LB Broth. shake that at 37C, 250rpm, until it reaches an optical desnity of OD600 = 0.450.
4. Split the culture into two 50mL sterile cebtrifuge tubes. Place those tubes in a tall cup of icewater and let the tubes incubate for 10mins in refrigerator.
5. Spin the tubes down for 5 minutes at 4000rpm in a 50mL centrifuge.
6. Decant the supernatant, place tubes in crushed ice bucket,  and use a 200uL pipette to suck up any residual liquid media. Do not disturb the pellet during this process.
7. To one of the spun down pellets add 1mL of ice cold TSS buffer. Cap tube and vortex briefly to fully resuspend the cells. Place tube immediately back on ice.
8. Remove the resupended cells and dispense them into the second pellet tube. Cap tube and vortex briefly to fully resuspend the cells. You now have both pellets in a single tube, resuspended in 1mL of TSS.
9. Move cells to a sterile 1.5mL tube on ice, label and freeze at -20C. cells viable for upwards of six weeks. Use 100uL per heatshock.
