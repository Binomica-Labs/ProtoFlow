Title: PCR Precipitation
Description: A simple and affordable PCR purification protocol via PEG and Salt precipitation.
1. To a completed PCR reaction in a 0.2mL PCR tube, add 1:1 PCR Precipitation Buffer.
2. Vortex briefly to mix.
3. Incubate at 37C in a PCR machine for 15 minutes.
4. Transfer to 1.5mL tubes and spin down 15mins at maximum speed.
5. Discard the supernatant.
6. Add 200uL of ice cold 80% Ethanol, vortex to mix, and spin down 10mins at max speed.
7. Decant supernatant and spin down 1min at max speed to collect residual alcohol.
8. Using a 200uL pipette, carefully remove residual solvent.
9. Dry at 37C for 5mins.
10. Resuspend in 20uL of DH2O, vortex thoroughly and spin down briefly to fully resuspend pellet.
11. Quantify DNA concentration via Qubit, Nanodrop, and/or Gel Electrophoresis.
