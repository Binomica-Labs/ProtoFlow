Title: Sowing Tobacco Seeds In-Vitro
Description: A way to surface sterilize and sow tobacco seeds in sterile media for later use in plant tissue culture and genetic engineering experiments.
1. Melt MS Agar in the microwave and pour into a few petri dishes. Let them set under laminar flow, cap, set upside down neatly in a stack.
2. To a sheet of paper towel, apply a light misting of 70% Isopropanol abd plsce it under laminar flow.
3. Sprinkle a poppyseed muffin top's worth of seeds onto the center or the damp paper towel. You don't need a ton of seeds, just be sure to disperse them evenly in about a 100mm circle.
4. Spray down the seeds and towel generously until papwr towel abd seeds are soaked. Be careful not to spray too close to the seeds or the jet of liquid will splash the seeds off the towel.
5. Allow the seeds and towel tondry until you can easily slide the paper towel on the surface of your sterile environment. Repeat step 4 and allow to dry once more.
6. Fold the paper towel inward and tap to move seeds to center of fold. These seeds are now sterile so do not make contact with them or near the center fold as this will act as a track for seed dispersal.
7. Hold the paper towel folded in half by the edges of the folds such that the center fold is tilted at a shallow angle. Open a petri dish of MS-Agar and carefully tap the towel from underneath to disperse 10-20 seeds onto the surface of the agar. Do not let the paper towel make contact with the MS Agar media. Cap the petri dish and label with today's date.
8. Place dishes under 16hr days, 10,000lux, room temp for 4-5 weeks.
