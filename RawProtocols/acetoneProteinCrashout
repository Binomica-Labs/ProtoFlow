Title: Simple Acetone Protein Crashout and Drying
Description: A way to crash out proteins in native buffer using acetone 
1. Isolate your protein of interest to the degree of purity you find applicable. This can be crude lysate or affinity purified. Elute in a comfortable buffer of your choice.
2. To a given volume of protein isolate, add one volume of pure acetone.
3. Vortex for a few seconds to ensure the solution mixes. The proteins will begin to crash out as a cloudy precipitate.
4. Spin down the solution at 4000rpm for 5 minutes. This can be a simple fixed-angle centrifuge used for spinning down E. coli cells.
5. Decant the supernatant carefully as to not disturb the pellet.
6. Resupend the pellet in 2 volumes of acetone by vortexing for a few seconds.
7. Spin down again as you did in step 4.
8. Decant carefully and allow tube to dry in ambient room temp. This will take a few minutes to over an hour depending on room humidity.
9. Scrape out the protein from the tube to store dry, or resuspend in your favorite buffer for downstream work.
