Title: Gene Shuffling Protocol for Rapid Evolution of Proteins
Description: A way to introduce random fragments of your target gene into the coding sequence of said gene via gene shuffling
1. Amplify the desired coding sequence using routine taq polymerase.
2. Add 1uL of DpnI directly to the PCR reaction and incubate for one hour at 37C to digest away any native DNA, leaving behind only intact PCR amplified DNA.
3. Purify the resulting amplification reaction via PCR Precipitation into 20uL of distilled H2O.
4. Digest 17uL of PCR amplicon using 1uL of DNA Shredding Buffer (1000x Dilution of NEB DNAseI Enzyme in 50% glycerol) along with 2uL of DNAseI Buffer (Manganese ions). The digestion time should be precisely 10 minutes at 37C followed by 75C for 10 minutes to heat kill the enzyme. I program my PCR machine to hold at 4C and load then diluted enzyme solution last. Quick vortex followed by immediate placement onto the PCR heatblock.
5. Run the digested PCR amplicon on a gel and isolate the 100bp to 300bp region of the smear into a sterile 1.5mL tube.
6. Proceed with gel purification (or freeze and squeeze method) and elute in 20uL of sterile distilled water.
7. Prepare a PCR reaction WITHOUT PRIMERS, using 2uL of the gel purified amplicon digest as template. This fragment pool will act as a random primer set which will anneal and assemble as random fragments. Run the PCR using the same program used to amplify your gene of interest initially. DO NOT FORGET TO OMIT PRIMERS; CRITICAL DETAIL. NO PRIMERS IN THIS REACTION.
8. PCR purify the resulting reaction using PCR Precipitation and elute in the same volume as the original PCR reaction.
9. Set up another PCR reaction, this time with primers that amplify your gene of interest along with the addition of restriction sites for later cloning.
10. Run an agarose gel to determine if the amplification was successful, there should be a DNA band of similar size to your original gene as the major product in the lane. There will likely be a smear; this is normal.
11 Isolate the bright PCR amplicon via gel purification (or PCR precipitate the whole reaction; this step needs empirical testing to see if worth the effort or not) and elute in 20uL of sterile distilled H2O.
12. Digest 16uL of your final shuffled amplicon library with the enzymes corresponding to the cut sites added by the previous PCR reaction, 1uL of each enzyme, followed by 2uL of Cutsmart Buffer. Incubate this reaction for 1hr at 37C. In another tube, digest a protein expression plasmid compatible with the aforementioned cut sites using the same enzymes and buffer.
13. Run an agarose gel to isolate the desired digested bands, plasmid backbone and insert, via gel purification (or freeze and squeeze) in separate tubes. Elute in 20uL of sterile distilled H2O.
14. Ligate the purified bands at 16C overnight using 17.5uL of insert, 17.5uL of backbone, 4uL of T4 Ligase Buffer, and 1uL of T4 DNA ligase in a sterile 0.2mL PCR Tube.
15. Transform 5uL of ligation reaction into 50uL of competent cells. Use a protein production strain of E. coli such as BL21; plate cells onto media with antibiotics corresponding to your backbone plasmid and incubate overnight at 37C. Transform cells with your original protein in a similar expression plasmid in another tube as a control.
16. Observe the resulting colonies for any change in color, size, or other signs of difference. If the expected change is visual, look for color or colony morphology changes. Note any strange observations.
17. Isolate expressed protein and/or test for enzymatic activity if your target protein is an enzyme.
