Title: Restriction Digest of Plasmid DNA via Traditional Cloning
Description: Preparing and cutting plasmids to clone parts into backbones.
1. Preheat a PCR machine to 37C. Thaw a vial of 10x Cutsmart Buffer (New England Biolabs) on ice.
2. To a sterile 0.2mL PCR tube, add 16uL of backbone plasmid. Label the tube with a "V" for "vector".
3. To another sterile 0.2mL PCR tube, add 16uL of donor plasmid which contains the insert you wish to clone. Label this tube with an "I" for "insert".
4. Thaw and dispense 2uL of 10x Cutsmart Buffer (New England Biolabs) to each tube. Keep the Cutsmart Buffer on ice once thawed.
5. To each tube add 1uL of the first restriction enzyme in your cloning plan.
6. To each tube add 1uL of the second restriction enzyme in your cloning plan.
7. Cap the tubes and vortex them in 3 pulses of 1 second to mix the contents thoroughly.
8. Incubate the reaction tubes for 1hr at 37C.
9. Remove the tubes from the PCR block and add 4uL of 6x Purple Loading Dye (New England Biolabs) to each tube.
10. Cap and vortex the tubes. Check if tube labels have smeared and rewrite them if need be. Your samples are now ready for a gel run.
