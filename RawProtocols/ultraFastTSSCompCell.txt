Title: Ultra Fast TSS Chemically Competent E. coli Cell prep
Description: How to make competent cells for heat shock transformation via TSS buffer with time-saving shortcuts.
1. Streak a sample of E. coli cells onto LB-Agar and incubate overnight at 37C.
2. The following day, select one colony with a sterile pipette tip or toothpick and place it in 20mL of liquid LB Broth in a 125mL erlenmeyer flask. shake the flask overnight at 37C, 250rpm.
3. The following day, dispense 1mL of the overnight culture into a sterile 2mL microcentrifuge tube on ice.
4. Spin down the cells for 15 seconds at 10,000G to gently pellet.
5. Decant supernatant completely and resuspend cells in 100uL of ice cold TSS Buffer on ice.
6. Aliquot 10uL of cells per heat shock reaction. Recommended heat shock parameters: 10mins ice incubation with plasmid, 42C 90sec shock, 5min ice recovery, 1hr 1mL LB 37C recovery, plate 100uL per petri dish.
7. Freeze at -20C or -80C. TSS is cryoprotectant but will only keep cells competent for 5 weeks at -20C. Minimize freeze thaw by aluqotting into 0.2mL PCR tubes.
