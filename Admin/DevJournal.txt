I totally forgot to start a journla logging the progress of this program's development so why not start now. Here we go!The aim
of the project is to make a simple protocol writer, reader, and manager for people to exchange protocols with. Each step in the
protocol has a header attached to it specifying the author's name, date generated, protocol title, protocol step name, and time
required for this step. The human readable output of these protocol files, when the user wishes to print or export, is a full 
color PDF with images outlining each step. Users can upload their protocol library to the community's GIT account and pull the
latest method chains from the repository. Every time you pull from this repositiory, all the protocols will be updated to the
latest versions. A git push will likely happen once a week at some universally agreed upon time as to keep the central repository
up to date. By not having to manage the actual servers and whatnot, we can focus on designing the client side steps and chains.
Glory be to GitHub!
